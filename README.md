I will add the abstract of the paper for interested readers: The Broglie's duality principle was introduced to the quantum mechanics field in the mid 1920's, stating that all particles also have wave properties such as frequency and wavelengths. Young's interforemeter experience (or Young's double-slit experiment) made it clear that the particles do indeed act as waves and pass through the 2 barriers, leaving behind them a sign of interference on the screen. The experiment can be explained as: an electron will pass through one of the barriers if it is being observed, and will act as a wave and pass through both barriers if it is not. The fact that quantum particles could behave differently when an observer was there makes us wonder: do they have consciousness of their own? In this paper, we propose a new way to prove the existence of quantum consciousness. We combine quantum mechanics and Artificial Intelligence to find the pattern behind subatomic particles' quantum properties. Our system is composed of 2 electrons, or 2 qubits (with 1/2 spin), in superposition and entangled to one another. This entanglement helps us to get more information about their properties by measuring them only for one qubit. We study the mathematical background behind this entanglement and trace out our subsystems to prove the entanglement's reversibility theoretically. We will be working on a 4 dimensional Hilbert space, which allows for mathematical operations to be applied to quantum systems. We put the two qubits inside a grid and use an agent acting as an observer to cause the wave function collapse for one of them. Then, we apply a von Neumann measurement to get the spin of that same qubit, leaving us with the other's spin as well. We introduce the reinforcement learning method to teach the agent how to look for the qubits and get to them using the shortest path on the grid. After many episodes and the agent learning's convergence, we introduce it multiple times to the grid to get us a sequence of spins. We display the algorithms we used, as well as a graphical interface for the agent. Finally, we move to the deep learning part, where we train and test 4 different neural networks on the spins we gathered. The resulting predictions and the accuracy of the networks led us to conduct a comparison study on their performances. Our final goal is for the agent to end up knowing the way the qubits think; what value will their quantum properties take after the next wave function collapse. We want to reduce the mystery behind quantum physics. 

You will find notebooks for both the reinforcement learning and the deep learning part, in addition to the data of the qubits spins that we got using IBM Quantum Lab.
